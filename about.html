    <h1>About</h1>
    <p id="about">UVMGuessr was developed by me (UVM Data Science senior Varun Vijay) after being given the idea by UVM Statistics senior Isaac Damon (both pictured below). Isaac and I have shared a passion for maps with one another since we met during our first year at UVM. That passion, combined with a shared love of the UVM campus among many of my friends and I, birthed this game. The pictures you are guessing from are all photos my friends and I have taken over our time here at UVM. You, too, can submit a photo by emailing it to me at vv646464@gmail.com! I hope you have as much fun playing as I have had coding this website. UVMGuessr is more than just a Geolocation game. It's an homage to the dorms, classrooms, and walkways with which we've found ourselves at home.</p>
